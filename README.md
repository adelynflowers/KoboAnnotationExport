## About

Kaet (pronounced kay-tee) is a desktop app that helps you manage highlights from your Kobo e-reader. Simply plugin your Kobo, open Kaet, and click "Yes" when prompted to extract your annotations. Thats it! Kaet offers the following features to simplify managing your highlights:

- Color coding your annotations for custom organization
- Adding notes to your annotations to help capture your thoughts
- Full text search through all of your annotations
- One click copying of your favorite annotations to the clipboard
- Exporting your annotations to a CSV file for safe keeping or use in other tools
- Filtering on colors and sorting by date
- A light and dark theme

Kaet is completely free and always will be. Manage your highlights without having to dig into your Kobo's filesystem and rest easy that your data never leaves your computer. See the downloads section on how to download and run the app on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

# Getting Started

Before getting started, you are advised to back up your kobo annotations. The app has not corrupted any databases thus far, but its better to be safe than sorry.

## Installation

### Linux

AppImages run with no further installation required. If you want to install it for easier access, consider installing [app image launcher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to integrate it into your system.

### Windows

You may get some security warnings from windows when you try to run the installer. There is nothing malicious in this program, windows is just picky about _who_ an installer is from. Once you accept the license agreement and install the program, it will be available from the start menu.

### MacOS

You may get some security warnings from Apple when trying to open the dmg. There is nothing malicious in this program, this is standard procedure for apps that don't pay $100 a year for a license from apple. See [this page from apple support](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac) on how to open the app in spite of this. Once the .dmg file is open, drag kaet to your applications folder to install it.

## Importing your highlights

Once you have the app open, plug in your kobo and make sure you click "trust this computer" on your ereader. kaet should then create a popup asking you if you want to import your highlights. Click yes, and your highlights should appear in the app.

## Viewing your highlights

You can view your highlights in two ways, grouped and ungrouped. This is controlled by the toggle switch at the top of the app. Grouped mode gathers your highlights up per book, allowing you to collapse and expand individual books for organization. Ungrouped mode shows you each individual annotation, with the book title in the display.

## Organizing your highlights

A simple search feature is provided which searches the title of the book as well as the content of the annotation.

In the top right of each annotation, you can tag it with up to three colors. By clicking the global colors near the search bar, you can filter to see only annotations tagged with that color.

In ungrouped mode, you can use the date sorter in the top right corner to sort your annotations by date, descending or ascending.

## Adding notes to your highlights

On the left hand side of each annotation there will be two icons that appear when hovered over. The one on the top will copy your note to the clipboard, and the one on the bottom will open up a drawer which will allow you to add your own notes to the annotation. Simply type in your desired message and hit enter and the note will be recorded and preserved upon export.

## Exporting your highlights

To export your highlights for use in kaet on another machine, or for storage elsewhere, you can click the export button at the top of the app. It will prompt you to choose a location, and then save your annotations as a CSV file in that folder.
